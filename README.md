I’ll loop back soon with the goods.

# DIY **1/8th Sleep** Cooling Sleep Pod – Build Guide

Building a **“1/8th Sleep”** pod means creating a personal sleep capsule with a cooled bed, blackout privacy, and noise reduction – all at a fraction of the cost of an Eight Sleep bed. This guide compiles community insights and provides a modular design that you can extend later for a second pod. We’ll cover **parts**, **tools**, and **step-by-step instructions**, with EU-sourced components and optional upgrades for lighting, ventilation, and acoustics.

## Background & Inspiration

The concept is inspired by Near’s *“1/8th Sleep”* project, which emulated the pricey Eight Sleep *Pod* (a smart cooling mattress) using DIY components ([
The 1/8th Sleep | near.blog	](https://near.blog/the-1-8th-sleep/#:~:text=The%20eight%20sleep%20bed%20is,option%20that%20I%20use%20instead)). Eight Sleep’s system can dynamically cool your bed surface to improve sleep but costs ~$3,000 plus subscription fees ([
The 1/8th Sleep | near.blog	](https://near.blog/the-1-8th-sleep/#:~:text=Although%20many%20of%20my%20friends,pillows%20and%20a%20bed%20sheet)). A homemade solution can achieve similar results for a few hundred dollars and **without** subscriptions or IoT snooping (Eight Sleep’s firmware infamously allowed engineers remote access ([Removing Jeff Bezos From My Bed ◆ Truffle Security Co.](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/removing-jeff-bezos-from-my-bed#:~:text=What%20does%20this%20mean%2C%20exactly%3F,computer%20any%20time%20they%20want)) ([Removing Jeff Bezos From My Bed ◆ Truffle Security Co.](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/removing-jeff-bezos-from-my-bed#:~:text=,you%20sleep))).

**How it works:** Instead of cooling your whole room, you’ll cool **your bed directly** by circulating chilled water through a thin mattress pad. This is far more efficient and effective – you cool *yourself*, not the entire bedroom ([I made a Custom Bed Watercooler! Open Source DIY Bed Cooler + Heater (Eight Sleep type thing) | TechteamGB](https://techteamgb.co.uk/2024/11/18/i-made-a-custom-bed-watercooler-open-source-diy-bed-cooler-heater-eight-sleep-type-thing/#:~:text=bed%2C%20all%20from%20my%20phone%2C,starting%20with%20the%20topper%20itself)). Users report it can lower the bed surface 6–7°C below ambient ([

In winter, the same setup (or a variant) can even pre-warm the bed for cozy nights ([I made a Custom Bed Watercooler! Open Source DIY Bed Cooler + Heater (Eight Sleep type thing) | TechteamGB](https://techteamgb.co.uk/2024/11/18/i-made-a-custom-bed-watercooler-open-source-diy-bed-cooler-heater-eight-sleep-type-thing/#:~:text=bed%2C%20all%20from%20my%20phone%2C,starting%20with%20the%20topper%20itself)).

Beyond cooling, we’ll enclose the bed to control light and noise. This is a modern twist on the traditional European “box-bed,” which was an enclosed bed cabinet providing privacy and warmth ([The closed bed, or box bed, was a traditional piece of furniture. In ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayWeWere/comments/113kx44/the_closed_bed_or_box_bed_was_a_traditional_piece/#:~:text=The%20closed%20bed%2C%20or%20box,helped%20to%20keep%20warm)). Our design uses blackout curtains and acoustic foam rather than solid wood panels, keeping it **simple and modular**.

## Design Overview

**Pod Structure:** A free-standing canopy frame encloses a twin mattress (approx. 90×200cm). The frame supports blackout curtains on all sides to create a dark, cozy micro-room. It’s essentially a small “bed fort” – similar in feel to a capsule hotel pod or a four-poster bed with heavy drapes. The enclosure helps block outside light and dampen sound.

**Cooling System:** Inside the pod, a water-filled cooling pad lies on the mattress, connected to an external chilling unit. A small **aquarium chiller** (water refrigeration unit) and pump circulate cold water through the pad, actively cooling your body. This DIY hydro-cooling system is the core of the “1/8th Sleep” setup ([
The 1/8th Sleep | near.blog	](https://near.blog/the-1-8th-sleep/#:~:text=Here%20is%20my%20current%20setup%2C,inspired%20fully%20by%20this%20tweet)). (For the initial build, we’ll set up one cooling circuit for one person. In the future, you can add a second, identical circuit for the other twin bed.)

**Modularity:** The frame is designed so that you can build a second one and place it adjacent for a double pod. Each pod is essentially a standalone unit – when side by side, you can either leave a curtain wall between them or remove that divider for a shared larger pod. This flexibility means you can start with one pod now and expand to two pods later without scrapping the first. The cooling system is also modular per bed – each sleeping surface gets its own pad and chiller for individual temperature control.

**Ventilation:** Because the pod can be closed up, we’ll ensure there’s some airflow. Our design isn’t fully airtight (there will be gaps at the bottom and a vent), but we’ll mention an optional quiet fan to circulate fresh air. This prevents stuffiness while still isolating you from light and noise.

## Parts and Materials

Below is a breakdown of the components you’ll need. We’ve included **EU-friendly sources** (Amazon DE, AliExpress EU, and Danish retailers) for each. You can substitute equivalent parts as available.

**1. Bed Cooling System – Water-Chilled Mattress Pad:**  
- **Water-circulation mattress pad with control unit** – This is a thin pad with embedded water tubes that goes on your mattress. Many kits are available (often from China) that include a pad plus a basic cooler/pump unit. For example, the *Adamson B10 Bed Cooling System* (Twin size ~90×190cm) is one such kit ([
The 1/8th Sleep | near.blog	](https://near.blog/the-1-8th-sleep/#:~:text=1.%20Low,180)). These units typically use an evaporative or Peltier cooler – functional but not very powerful. The pad itself is the crucial part. Expect to pay ~€100–€150 for a twin-size pad + basic cooler bundle. (Brands: **Adamson B10**, **Potow**, **Yijingrui**, etc., often found on Amazon or AliExpress.)  
  - *Source:* Amazon DE carries water-cooled mattress systems – e.g. a kit by YJINGRUI with a 1.7 L tank and digital controls ([YJINGRUI Water-Cooled Mattress System 1.7-3L Capacity Electric ...](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/YJINGRUI-Water-Cooled-Mattress-Capacity-Electric/dp/B0C7C5B3RJ#:~:text=YJINGRUI%20Water,7%20litre)). AliExpress also has “water cooling mattress pad” kits (search for *bed cooling system* with EU shipping). Ensure you get the correct size pad (Nordic twin ~90–100×200cm).  

- **Aquarium chiller (active cooling unit)** – To upgrade cooling performance, add a small **compressor-based chiller** that can chill water to your target temperature. The DIY community found that inexpensive aquarium chillers provide functionality similar to Eight Sleep’s cooling unit ([Removing Jeff Bezos From My Bed ◆ Truffle Security Co.](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/removing-jeff-bezos-from-my-bed#:~:text=It%20turns%20out%20inexpensive%20Aquarium,with%20a%20bunch%20of%20developers)). Look for ~1/10 HP aquarium chillers (designed for ~100–160 L fish tanks). For example, **Poafamx 42Gal (160 L) Aquarium Chiller** or **BAOSHISHAN 1/10 HP chiller** are available on Amazon. These units have a refrigeration compressor and built-in thermostat control (typically able to cool water to ~10–15°C). Expect ~€150–€300.  
  - *Source:* On Amazon.de, check *Heaters & Chillers* in Pet Supplies – e.g., *BAOSHISHAN 160L Aquarium Chiller (1/10 HP)* ([BAOSHISHAN 1/10 HP Titanium Aquarium Chiller, 160L Water ...](https://www.amazon.co.uk/BAOSHISHAN-160L-Refrigeration-hydroponics-42gal/dp/B0C6HWWCFK#:~:text=BAOSHISHAN%201%2F10%20HP%20Titanium%20Aquarium,Weeds%2C%20Jellyfish%2C%20Coral%2C%20Crystal%20Shrimp)). Ensure you get a **220–240V model** for EU (some listings are 110V). Some models ship from China via AliExpress (look for EU warehouses to avoid import hassle). Brands like *Hailea* or *AquaEuro* are also options if found locally (sometimes via aquarium supply stores).

- **Water pump and tubing:** If your chiller doesn’t include a pump, get a small **submersible water pump** (rated ~200–400 L/hour) to drive water through the pad. Many aquarium chillers come with a pump or at least specify the needed flow rate. Also get extra **tubing** that fits the pad and chiller. Most bed pads use silicone tubes (~6–8 mm inner diameter). Acquire a few meters of the appropriate size tube to extend the reach from your bed to the chiller on the floor ([
The 1/8th Sleep | near.blog	](https://near.blog/the-1-8th-sleep/#:~:text=2.%20Replace%20the%20above%20low,20)). Also grab some metal hose clamps or zip ties to secure connections.  
  - *Source:* Any aquarium store or Amazon has small 12V or AC pumps. For example, a 300 L/h mini submersible pump is about €10–€20. Clear PVC or silicone tubing of the matching diameter can be found at Bauhaus or Harald Nyborg in DK, or online (often sold by the meter).

- **Insulated water reservoir:** A small **cooler box** (ice chest) to hold the water can improve cooling. In Near’s build, an inexpensive mini cooler (~10 L) is used as the water tank ([
The 1/8th Sleep | near.blog	](https://near.blog/the-1-8th-sleep/#:~:text=3,20)). The chiller’s heat exchanger coil and the pump can sit inside this insulated box, which helps keep the water cold. You can even drop in ice packs at night for an extra boost. A 5–15 L camping cooler works well.  
  - *Source:* Harald Nyborg, Biltema, or Bauhaus in Denmark carry small cooler boxes (often in the sports/outdoor section). Even a styrofoam insulation box could work in a pinch, though a sturdy plastic cooler is preferable.

- **Smart plug (optional):** A Wi-Fi smart plug lets you schedule or remotely toggle the chiller/pump system ([
The 1/8th Sleep | near.blog	](https://near.blog/the-1-8th-sleep/#:~:text=5,20)). Not strictly necessary, but convenient for turning the cooling on before you get in bed or automating it with your routine.  
  - *Source:* TP-Link Kasa or IKEA TRÅDFRI smart plugs are available in Denmark (~100 DKK). Ensure it can handle the chiller’s wattage (most small chillers draw <200W, so a standard 10A plug is fine).

**2. Pod Enclosure & Frame:**  
- **Wood for frame:** We recommend **wooden beams (lumber)** to construct a canopy frame around the bed. Choose dimension timber that’s sturdy but not too bulky – e.g., 38×38 mm or 45×45 mm pine/spruce is ideal for corner posts and crossbeams. You’ll need 4 vertical posts (height to cover the bed plus some headroom – ~2 m) and horizontal pieces to connect them at top (forming a rectangular prism). Additional wood can create middle braces or a headboard panel if desired. Optionally, a sheet of **plywood** can be used as a headboard or ceiling panel for mounting accessories (this also helps soundproofing if padded).  
  - *Source:* Bauhaus or Stark in DK for lumber – ask for 2×2 or 2×4 studs cut to length. (Many stores will cut to length for you, which helps if you don’t have a saw.) Also get some small metal L-brackets or wood screws for assembly.

- **Blackout curtains:** Thick **blackout curtain panels** will serve as the pod’s walls. These will hang from the frame on all sides (except perhaps the bottom which stays open). Blackout curtains are made of tightly woven, often foam-backed fabric that blocks nearly 100% of light – *“effectively blocks out all light… Perfect for people who are sensitive to light during sleep”* ([MAJGULL Blackout curtains, 1 pair, gray, 57x98" - IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/majgull-black-out-curtains-1-pair-gray-with-heading-tape-50417812/#:~:text=The%20block,prevents%20glare%20on%20TV%27s)). They also add a bit of sound absorption due to their heavy fabric. You’ll need enough panels to fully surround one twin bed: typically 4 panels (~2 for long sides, 1 each for front/back) depending on width. Aim for curtain length that reaches floor for maximum darkness (around 200–220 cm drop). Dark colors (black, navy, dark gray) work best for blocking light.  
  - *Source:* **IKEA MAJGULL** blackout curtains (145×250 cm each) are a budget-friendly option ([MAJGULL Blackout curtains, 1 pair, gray, 57x98" - IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/majgull-black-out-curtains-1-pair-gray-with-heading-tape-50417812/#:~:text=The%20block,prevents%20glare%20on%20TV%27s)) – two pairs would cover a twin pod. Jysk and Ikea in DK have various blackout curtains; Amazon.de offers brands like Nicetown. You can also use heavy duty **blackout fabric** from a textile store if you prefer to sew custom-sized drapes.

- **Curtain hanging hardware:** There are a few ways to hang the curtains on your frame:
  - Simplest: staple or Velcro the top edge of curtains directly to the wooden frame. This is easy, but curtains will be fixed (you’d overlap panels to create “doors”). 
  - Preferred: use curtain rods or wires so you can slide curtains open/closed. For example, mount **curtain rods** along the inside of the top frame beams. Telescoping spring-rods or wire curtain systems can also work if the frame is square. You might use an Ikea cable system or even repurpose shower-curtain tension rods.
  - Ensure there is overlap or a flap where curtains meet so no light leaks through seams. Attaching Velcro strips along the vertical edges of curtain panels can help seal corners when closed.

- **Acoustic foam panels (optional):** To further **soundproof** the pod, you can line parts of the interior with acoustic foam. These are the wedge or pyramid-shaped foam panels used in studios. They **absorb echoes and dampen noise** (especially higher frequencies) ([Ohuhu Akustikschaumstoff Akustikpaneele 12 Stück mit Aufkleber ...](https://www.amazon.de/Ohuhu-Akustikschaumstoff-Akustikpaneele-Schallabsorber-Akustikschaumstoff-Matten/dp/B0CND18SW6#:~:text=Ohuhu%20Akustikschaumstoff%20Akustikpaneele%2012%20St%C3%BCck,5%20cm%20dicke%20Pyramidenoberfl%C3%A4che)). While they won’t block loud noise entirely (low frequencies will still penetrate), they reduce overall noise and create a quieter ambiance inside the pod. Even a few panels at the head end and ceiling can help. Look for panels ~30×30 cm in size, 3–5 cm thick. They can be attached to the wood frame or a plywood panel with glue or velcro.  
  - *Source:* Amazon.de sells packs of acoustic foam (e.g., 12-pack of 30×30×5 cm pyramid foam) ([Ohuhu Akustikschaumstoff Akustikpaneele 12 Stück mit Aufkleber ...](https://www.amazon.de/Ohuhu-Akustikschaumstoff-Akustikpaneele-Schallabsorber-Akustikschaumstoff-Matten/dp/B0CND18SW6#:~:text=Ohuhu%20Akustikschaumstoff%20Akustikpaneele%2012%20St%C3%BCck,5%20cm%20dicke%20Pyramidenoberfl%C3%A4che)). Thomann.de (a German music gear site) also sells acoustic foam with EU shipping. As a low-cost alternative, thick blankets or moving pads hung on the walls can also add sound absorption (not as effective per thickness, but better than bare wood).

**3. Accessories & Upgrades:**  
- **LED lighting:** Inside your pod, add some **LED lights** for comfort and ambiance. An LED strip along the top perimeter works great as indirect lighting. Choose a dimmable warm-colored strip or an RGB strip with remote/app control for customizable mood lighting. You can stick the strip to the inside of the top frame. Make sure to route the power cable out of the pod (along a post) to an outlet (possibly plug into the same smart plug or a separate one).  
  - *Source:* A 5 m self-adhesive RGB LED strip kit (with power adapter and remote) is inexpensive on Amazon ([Led Strip 5m - Suchergebnis Auf Amazon.de Für](https://www.amazon.de/led-strip-5m/s?k=led+strip+5m#:~:text=LED%20Strip%205m%2C%20LED%20Streifen,LED%20%C2%B7%204%2C)). Also check local stores like Harald Nyborg or Bilka for LED light strips or even battery-powered LED puck lights if you prefer a simpler solution. 

- **Ventilation fan:** If you find the air gets stale or warm (from your body heat) in the closed pod, consider a small **ventilation fan**. A quiet USB fan mounted near the top can draw warm air out, or push fresh air in. Even a PC case fan (120 mm) running at 5–7V (to lower its speed) can work silently. You can cut a small vent hole in a top corner of a curtain or mount the fan on top of the frame, blowing out. This will pull in fresh air from the gap under the curtains. Keep the airflow gentle to avoid a draft on you.  
  - *Source:* 120 mm USB fans are common (often used for AV cabinet cooling). For example, AC Infinity MULTIFAN or generics on Amazon (~€15). USB-powered means you can run it off a phone charger or power bank. Alternatively, a quiet desktop fan placed at a corner of the pod aimed upward can help circulate air when needed.

- **Miscellaneous:** Don’t forget **small items** like heavy-duty Velcro (for attaching foam panels or securing curtain edges), zip ties (for cable management and securing tubes), and perhaps a **temperature sensor** or thermometer to monitor inside conditions. A battery clock or smart display can be a nice touch inside as well.

### Tools Required

You mentioned having basic tools; here are the additional tools or equipment you’ll likely need for this build:

- **Drill/Driver** – For making pilot holes and driving screws into the wood. (If you don’t have one, a screwdriver and some muscle can suffice, but drilling is highly recommended for  screws to avoid splitting the wood.)
- **Saw** – To cut lumber to size if not pre-cut. A hand saw will do for a few cuts, or have the store cut the pieces. A jigsaw or circular saw is handy for cutting plywood panels.
- **Measuring tape, pencil, level** – To measure and mark where to drill or cut, and ensure your frame is square and level.
- **Screws, brackets, and screwdriver** – Wood screws (~4×50mm) to join beams. Metal L-brackets or flat plates can reinforce corners. A small wrench may be needed for any bolts if you use carriage bolts for joints (optional but makes disassembly easier if needed).
- **Staple gun or tacks** – If you plan to attach curtains or fabric directly to the wood, a heavy-duty staple gun will make it quick.
- **Scissors/utility knife** – For cutting fabric, tape, trimming foam, or tubing.
- **Plumbing tape (Teflon tape)** – Useful to seal any threaded connections in the cooling system (to prevent leaks on hose barb threads, etc.).
- **Safety gear** – e.g. goggles (if cutting wood) and gloves (when handling wood or cutting foam).

*(If you lack any cutting tools and prefer not to do carpentry, an alternative is to use **PVC pipes** or metal pipe fittings to build a canopy frame – many DIYers use PVC for lightweight bed canopies ([DIY PVC Pipe Bed Canopy - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA_71DLkfxg#:~:text=DIY%20PVC%20Pipe%20Bed%20Canopy,made)). Pipes can be cut at the store and assembled with corner joints, then draped with fabric. However, a wood frame will be sturdier for hanging heavy curtains and foam.)*

## Step-by-Step Build Instructions

Follow these steps to construct your sleep pod. Adjust dimensions to fit your bed and room as needed.

**1. Build the Frame**  
   - **Layout & Cuts:** Measure the footprint of your twin mattress. Plan for the frame to surround it with a little extra space (a few cm clearance). Cut the wood for four **vertical posts** – about 200 cm tall (or to your ceiling height minus some clearance, if your room is short). Cut **horizontal pieces** for the top: two long beams (length of bed + small overhang, ~210 cm) and two shorter beams (width of bed + clearance, ~100 cm). Also cut four pieces for base supports (these can sit on the floor connecting the posts at bottom, but it’s optional – the bed itself can act as a stabilizer for the bottom). If you have extra wood, also cut one or two mid-level crossbars for the back or head side to stiffen the frame.
   - **Post Assembly:** Stand up two posts at the head of the bed and two at the foot. Have a helper hold them, or temporarily brace them. Attach the top beams: use screws or brackets to secure a long beam across the two posts on one side, and the second long beam across the other side. Then attach the short top beams to connect the sides, forming a rectangle. This top rectangle and the four posts form a rigid canopy frame. Use at least two screws per joint (drill pilot holes first). Ensure the structure is not wobbly – add angle brackets or corner braces as needed at the top joints.
   - **Stabilize:** If possible, also secure the frame to an adjacent wall for stability (for example, L-brackets from the top beam to the wall). If not, make sure to add **diagonal bracing** or lower crosspieces. One simple method: screw a plywood sheet to the back side of the frame (behind the head of the bed). This sheet will act as a headboard and will rigidify the whole frame into a square. (You can pad/upholster this plywood headboard with foam for comfort/noise absorption).
   - *Tip:* Check that the frame is plumb (vertical posts straight up) and square at corners using a level or measuring the diagonals. It doesn’t need to be perfect, but the closer the better for curtains to hang nicely.

**2. Install the Enclosure (Curtains & Foam)**  
   - **Curtains:** Mount your blackout curtains on each side of the frame’s top. If using rods, install the rod brackets on the inside of the frame (or run a taut curtain wire). Hang the curtain panels so they can slide or at least be opened. Typically, you’d have one panel for the head end, one or two for the foot end (entrance), and one or two on each long side. Arrange overlaps: e.g. two panels meeting in the middle for the front opening, so you can tie them back or Velcro shut. Ensure they cover all gaps – it should be draped such that when closed, you’re in near-total darkness.  
     For a simpler approach, you can staple a curtain panel on each side permanently. This maximizes light blocking (no gap), but you’ll need to include an entry (perhaps leave the foot panel as a curtain that you push aside to get in).
   - **Seal Light Leaks:** Use adhesive Velcro strips along the frame where curtain edges meet, so you can press them closed. You can also attach a valance or overlap at the top if light escapes there. The goal is a **dark interior** even at midday.
   - **Acoustic Treatment:** If you have acoustic foam panels, attach them to the inside of the frame where they won’t be in your way. Good spots are: the interior of the headboard panel, the ceiling (underside of the top frame) above your head, and upper side walls. This will reduce echoes inside the pod and provide some noise damping from outside. The foam can be glued or use double-sided tape/velcro. Even without foam, the heavy curtains themselves will help muffle sound (and you can always use earplugs for total silence). Remember, true sound-*proofing* is difficult – but our aim is to soften noises (and the pod will also mask noise by virtue of enclosing you). 

**3. Set Up the Cooling System**  
   - **Positioning:** Place the water chiller unit and/or the original pad control unit near the bed. Ideally, put them on the floor at the foot or side of the bed, outside the pod curtains. (For example, you can cut a small opening at the foot curtain’s bottom corner just large enough to pass the hoses and power cord through, so the devices stay outside for noise and space reasons.) If you’re using a cooler box as reservoir, you can put the pump and chiller coil inside it, next to the bed or under an open-frame bed.
   - **Pad Installation:** Lay the water-circulation mattress pad on top of your mattress, then put your regular bedsheet over it. Most pads are thin and flexible, so you shouldn’t feel the tubes much, especially with a sheet on top. Make sure the tubes from the pad (usually two tubes) are routed to the back or foot of the bed, where they will connect to the cooler. **Protect the tubes** from kinking – run them in a gentle arc, and you may want to pad the point where they exit the pod frame (a bit of foam or fabric wrap, so they don’t rub on wood edges).
   - **Connect Hoses:** Attach the pad’s hoses to your chiller/pump system. This will vary by components:
     - If using the original control unit (from the pad kit) initially: simply connect the pad hoses to that unit as per its manual. (Usually just push-on or screw-on connections). Fill its reservoir with distilled water to the indicated level.
     - If using the aquarium chiller + external pump: run a hose from the **pump outlet** to one end of the mattress pad, then from the pad’s other end back to the **chiller inlet** (or reservoir). Essentially you’re creating a closed loop: Reservoir → Pump → Pad → Chiller → back to Reservoir. Make sure the flow direction matches any guidance from chiller (some chillers have the pump push water *into* them). Use clamps on hose fittings to prevent leaks. 
     - If your chiller has its own integrated pump, you’ll have just two ports (outlet to pad, and return from pad). Connect accordingly.
   - **Fill the Loop:** Open the fill port (either on the pad’s original unit or the reservoir) and pour in **distilled water** (distilled is best to avoid algae and mineral build-up). Fill until the pad and hoses are full and no large air bubbles remain. Some kits include a little hand pump to purge air ([Review of the EU Super King sized pad : r/HydroSnoozeCoolingPad](https://www.reddit.com/r/HydroSnoozeCoolingPad/comments/1g9u6ne/review_of_the_eu_super_king_sized_pad/#:~:text=)) – if not, you can often lift the pad higher than the pump to let air purge out, or disconnect a hose at the highest point to bleed air, then reattach.
   - **Test Run:** Before first use, do a trial run *during the day*. Turn on the pump and chiller. Set the chiller to a cool temperature (say 20°C to start). Watch for any leaks at connections – tighten if needed. You should feel the pad begin to cool after a few minutes. Confirm the chiller’s radiator fan is running and that its temperature display is dropping. Also check noise levels – most aquarium chillers have a gentle hum of a fan/compressor, which should be barely audible when you’re inside the pod with curtains closed (the heavy fabric will dampen it further). If the noise is bothersome, you can place the chiller on a soft mat to reduce vibration and ensure it’s outside the pod.
   - **Optimize:** Once you know it’s leak-free, you can optimize the setup:
     - Put the lid on your cooler-box reservoir (with cutouts for hoses) to keep it insulated. You can pre-chill the water in the reservoir by adding a frozen gel pack or a bit of ice each night – this can help the chiller get to target temp faster ([
The 1/8th Sleep | near.blog	](https://near.blog/the-1-8th-sleep/#:~:text=ImageA%2012%E2%84%89%20difference%20between%20the,challenging%20with%20the%20pictured%20thermometer)) (just don’t overdo ice, or you risk condensation on hoses).
     - Program the smart plug if using one – for example, have it turn on the cooling system 30 minutes before your bedtime, so the bed is already cold when you get in. *(Waking up to a warm bed? You can similarly schedule it to turn off or warm up in the early morning if you like, though the DIY system won’t have the “sleep stage automation” of Eight Sleep unless you add smart home code.)*

**4. Add Lighting and Final Touches**  
   - **LEDs:** Mount your LED strip inside the pod. A common approach is to run an LED strip along the top frame on the side or behind a lip, so it’s indirect. Since your frame is wood, you can simply stick the strip on it (most have peel-and-stick backing). Route its power cord to a corner and out of the pod (you can drill a small hole in the frame or run it out under a curtain). Plug it into an outlet or the smart plug (if you want it to follow the same schedule, or connect to a smart home system). Test the remote or app to adjust brightness and color. Set it to a very dim red or amber at night to avoid disrupting melatonin (or just turn it off – the idea is to have *complete darkness* for sleep).
   - **Bed setup:** Make the bed as usual, with the cooling pad under the sheet. Use a comfortable pillow and any bedding you prefer. Keep in mind heavy duvets will trap heat *from above*, so in summer you might use a lighter blanket since your underside is being cooled by the pad. In winter, you can still use the pad in heating mode (if your unit supports it or by simply setting a warmer target).
   - **Interior organization:** It can get very cozy inside, so consider a few conveniences:
     - A small **side pocket** or caddy that hangs on the frame for your phone, book, or water bottle.
     - If you want to use a tablet or reading material, maybe a clip-on light (or just the LED strip on a brighter setting).
     - **Emergency exit:** Ensure you can open the curtains quickly from inside. It’s a good idea to have at least one Velcro strap or an easy-open overlap for a quick exit (especially important if you wake up disoriented – practice opening the “door” so it’s second nature).
     - **Ventilation:** If you opted for a fan, mount it now. One method: rest a USB fan on top of the frame at a corner, blowing outward, and crack open a small gap on the opposite corner for intake. Even without a dedicated fan, you’ll likely have enough airflow from the natural gaps (especially at floor level) to get fresh air – just avoid sealing *everything* too tightly. If you notice condensation or stuffiness, increase airflow.

**5. Testing and Tweaking:**  
Sleep in the pod for a few nights and observe:
   - Temperature: Find your preferred bed temperature. Some like ~18°C surface for cool sleep; others a bit warmer. Adjust the chiller’s thermostat accordingly. Remember, “cold” water can draw moisture – if you see any condensation on the pad or hoses (unlikely unless your room is very humid), slightly raise the temp to prevent that.
   - Noise: See if any noises disturb you. The chiller turning on/off might create slight humming – placing it on a foam pad or in the next room with longer hoses (if feasible) could be solutions. Internally, the silence might actually amplify small noises (your own breathing, etc.). Some users like to introduce **white noise** (a fan or a noise machine) to mask outside sounds instead of trying to block 100% of noise.
   - Light: Check for any light leaks (e.g., under the frame if the bed is taller, or where pipes/cables exit). You might add a skirt or draft stopper at the bottom if needed.
   - Comfort: The mattress pad should be barely noticeable. If you do feel tubing, you can add a mattress topper over it (e.g., a thin foam layer *above* the water pad, which will slightly reduce cooling efficiency but improve cushioning). Andrew McDonald, who built a similar cooler, cut a niche into a foam topper for tubing to make it “invisible” ([I made a Custom Bed Watercooler! Open Source DIY Bed Cooler + Heater (Eight Sleep type thing) | TechteamGB](https://techteamgb.co.uk/2024/11/18/i-made-a-custom-bed-watercooler-open-source-diy-bed-cooler-heater-eight-sleep-type-thing/#:~:text=As%20it%20turns%20out%2C%20I,and%20what%20fits%20on%20the)) – but that’s more advanced. Generally, a well-made pad (often cotton or mesh on top) will feel fine under a sheet.

## Optional Upgrades and Future Expansion

Once your solo sleep pod is running smoothly, you can consider these enhancements and how to expand to a second unit:

- **Add a Second Pod:** To accommodate your partner with their own cooled pod, simply replicate the frame and cooling setup for the other twin bed. You can share the middle post/wall or build the second frame independently and push them together. The curtains on the adjoining side can be left tied open or removed if you prefer a shared space sometimes. (One idea: use a heavy curtain or even a sliding panel between the two pods – open it when you want a larger combined pod, close it when one person wants a cave and the other doesn’t). Each pod should have its own cooling pad and chiller for individualized temperature. This modular approach keeps things flexible.

- **Integrated Climate Control:** Smart home enthusiasts might integrate the cooling system with sensors. For example, use a smart plug or DIY Arduino/Raspberry Pi to regulate water temperature based on a schedule or your sleep stages (if you wear a tracker that can trigger events). This gets complex, but it’s possible – one Redditor suggested using a fitness tracker’s API to adjust a DIY bed cooler ([The Nein Sleep. The DIY Eight Sleep? : r/EightSleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/EightSleep/comments/18c6jhr/the_nein_sleep_the_diy_eight_sleep/#:~:text=2,to%20drive%20the%20temperature%20setting)). At minimum, you could use a simple thermostat plug to turn off the chiller if it gets too cold.

- **Heating Mode:** Many water-cooling systems can also heat. If your aquarium chiller is actually a cooler/heater or if you kept the original unit (which sometimes can heat up to ~50°C), you can use the pod in winter for toasty warm bed. Just be cautious to not overheat or you’ll wake up sweaty – a mild warmth (like electric blanket effect) is usually enough.

- **Improved Soundproofing:** For further noise reduction, consider adding **mass** to the structure. Mass Loaded Vinyl (MLV) sheets or dense blankets clipped behind the curtains can block more sound. You could also replace some curtain sections with solid panels (e.g., a plywood door) but that makes it less modular. Another tactic is to use **white noise or soothing sounds** inside the pod – a small speaker or noise machine can make external noises less noticeable by creating a constant gentle sound. Many people find a fan hum or rain sounds very conducive to sleep.

- **Aesthetics & Comfort:** Customize the look! Since this is in your bedroom, you can paint or stain the wood frame to match furniture, or wrap the exterior of the pod with a decorative fabric so it looks less like a “box”. Inside, you could line the ceiling with a tapestry or put up star-fairy-lights (just keep it fire-safe and powered by LED/battery). Add throw pillows or your favorite bedding to make it inviting. The pod should feel like **your personal cocoon** – both relaxing and rejuvenating.

- **Maintenance:** Every few months, check the water in the cooling system. If you see algae or cloudiness, flush it and refill with fresh distilled water (you can add a drop of aquarium algaecide or a silver coil to inhibit growth). Also vacuum or dust the chiller’s air intakes so it runs efficiently. The mattress pad can be cleaned per its instructions (usually you can’t wash it fully, but you can wipe it with a mild disinfectant). Curtain maintenance is simple – most blackout curtains can be machine washed (or at least vacuumed) to keep them clean and dust-free.

- **Safety notes:** Always ensure electrical components are kept dry and ventilated. The chiller should sit where it can get airflow for its cooling fan (outside the curtain). Keep the water hoses tightly connected – a leak inside the pod could wet your mattress. It’s wise to test any changes (like adding ice or adjusting flow) while awake to avoid midnight surprises. Finally, since you are effectively sleeping in a small enclosed space, ensure you’re comfortable with that. If you ever feel claustrophobic, you can use a lighter curtain or leave a “window” open. Over time, many people come to love the secure, nest-like feeling of a sleep pod.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you now have a **dark, cool, and quiet sleep sanctuary** in your own home. You’ve combined the benefits of cutting-edge bed cooling technology with simple DIY construction and materials. Early adopters of similar setups have reported deeper and more restful sleep, attributing it to the stable cool temperature and the elimination of disturbances ([
