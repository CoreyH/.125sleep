# DIY **1/8th Sleep** Mattress Cooling System – Build Guide

> **Last Updated:** December 2025

Building a **"1/8th Sleep"** system means creating a cooled bed at a fraction of the cost of an Eight Sleep Pod. This guide compiles community insights and provides current recommendations for both **buying a ready-made solution** and **building your own**.

---

## TL;DR: Your Two Options

| Option | Cost | Effort | Reliability | Best For |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Buy: ChiliPad Cube** | ~$650 | Plug & play | High | Want it to "just work" |
| **DIY: 1/8th Sleep Build** | ~$315-415 | Medium | Medium-High | Budget-conscious, tinkerers |

---

## Option 1: Just Buy It – ChiliPad Cube (~$650)

**As of May 2025, SleepMe eliminated all subscription fees.** This makes the ChiliPad Cube the best "buy" option for reliable, no-hassle cooling.

### Why ChiliPad Cube?

- **No subscription** – One-time purchase, no ongoing fees
- **Temperature range**: 55-115°F (13-46°C)
- **Proven reliability** – Years of positive reviews
- **Quiet operation** – Won't disturb sleep
- **Dual-zone available** – Each partner controls their side

### Pricing (2025)

| Size | Single ("ME") | Dual ("WE") |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Twin/Twin XL | $649 | — |
| Queen | $699 | $1,249 |
| King/Cal King | $749 | $1,449 |

**Where to buy:** [sleep.me](https://sleep.me/product/cube-sleep-system)

### Why NOT Eight Sleep?

Eight Sleep now **requires a $200/year subscription** to access basic features. The Pod 5 costs ~$3,348 + $200/yr. Without the subscription, it becomes a "dumb cooling pad" with manual controls only. The ChiliPad Cube offers similar cooling performance without the subscription lock-in.

---

## Option 2: DIY Build (~$315-415)

The DIY approach uses an **aquarium chiller** to cool water flowing through a **mattress cooling pad**. This setup can cool your bed 6-10°C below ambient temperature.

### Component Overview

| Component | Budget | Recommended | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Mattress Pad | $100 | $140 | Adamson B10 is proven |
| Aquarium Chiller | $150 | $180 | Most important component |
| Water Pump | $12 | $15 | Upgrade from pad's weak pump |
| Silicone Tubing | $10 | $15 | Get extra length |
| Insulated Reservoir | $15 | $25 | Any small cooler works |
| Accessories | $25 | $40 | Smart plug, clamps, etc. |
| **TOTAL** | **~$312** | **~$415** | |

### Purchase Order

Buy components in this order:

1. **Mattress pad first** – Determines tube sizing for other components
2. **Chiller second** – Often ships from China (longest wait)
3. **Pump + tubing together** – Ensure compatible sizing
4. **Reservoir + accessories** – Can source locally

## DIY Component Deep Dive

### 1. Mattress Cooling Pad (~$100-180)

The pad contains silicone tubes that water flows through. You'll use the pad but replace its weak cooling unit with an aquarium chiller.

| Option | Price | Size | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------|------|------|------|
| **Adamson B10** | ~$140 | Twin (75"x39") | 100% cotton, 5-yr warranty, proven in DIY builds | Twin only, weak built-in cooler |
| **YJINGRUI Kit** | ~$100-150 | Various | Digital controls, multiple sizes | Mixed quality control |
| **Generic AliExpress** | ~$60-100 | Various | Cheapest | Quality lottery, slow shipping |

**Recommendation:** The **Adamson B10** is the safest choice. It has a proven track record in DIY builds, good build quality, and a 5-year warranty. You'll discard its weak evaporative cooler but keep the excellent pad.

- [Adamson B10 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Adamson-B10-Bed-Cooling-System/dp/B0B96VK75R)
- [Adamson Official Site](https://adamsonglobal.com/products/b10-bed-cooling-system)

**Tube diameter:** The Adamson uses ~6-8mm ID silicone tubing. Match your pump/chiller fittings to this.

### 2. Aquarium Chiller (~$150-300)

This is your **most important and most expensive component**. It actively refrigerates the water to your target temperature.

| Option | Price | HP | Capacity | Noise | Notes |
|--------|-------|----|----|-------|-------|
| **BAOSHISHAN 1/10 HP** | ~$180-220 | 0.1 | 42gal/160L | Moderate | Most common in DIY builds |
| **Poafamx 1/10 HP** | ~$180-200 | 0.1 | 42gal | Moderate | Same OEM as BAOSHISHAN |
| **VEVOR 1/10 HP** | ~$150-180 | 0.1 | 40gal | Moderate | Budget option |
| **JBJ Arctica** | ~$400+ | Various | Various | Very quiet | Premium, 2-yr warranty |

**Recommendation:** **BAOSHISHAN or Poafamx 1/10 HP** (~$180-200). They're from the same OEM, proven to work, and can maintain water at 15-20°C reliably. Can drop bed temp 6-10°C below ambient.

**Important considerations:**
- Get the **220-240V model** for EU (many listings are 110V)
- Customer service is reportedly poor – if it breaks, plan to replace
- Place on a foam mat to reduce vibration noise
- Position outside the bedroom if noise is a concern (use longer tubes)

**Where to buy:**
- [BAOSHISHAN on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/BAOSHISHAN-Aquarium-Chiller-Hydroponics-Refrigeration/dp/B0716XSSC4)
- [Amazon DE for EU](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/BAOSHISHAN-Aquarium-Chiller-Hydroponics-Refrigeration/dp/B0716XSSC4)
- AliExpress (search "1/10 HP aquarium chiller" – look for EU warehouse)

### 3. Water Pump (~$15-30)

The pad's built-in pump is usually underpowered. Upgrade to a dedicated submersible pump.

| Option | Price | Flow | Voltage | Noise | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Decdeal DC 12V** | ~$15 | 280 L/h | 12V DC | <35dB | Ultra-quiet, proven |
| **MOUNTAIN_ARK 12V** | ~$12-15 | 240 L/h | 12V DC | Low | 2-pack available |
| **Generic 300 L/h** | ~$10-20 | 300 L/h | 220V AC | Moderate | Works but louder |

**Recommendation:** **Decdeal DC 12V** (~$15). Ultra-quiet operation and 12V means you can power it from a USB adapter.

- [Decdeal Pump on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Decdeal-Submersible-Water-Ultra-quiet-Aquarium/dp/B00JWJIC0K)

**Flow rate:** 200-400 L/h is ideal. Too slow = poor heat transfer. Too fast = noise and stress on connections.

---

### 4. Silicone Tubing (~$10-20)

Food-grade silicone tubing connects all components. Get more than you think you need.

| Option | Size | Price | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| **Quickun Food Grade** | 8mm ID x 12mm OD | ~$15/5m | FDA compliant, kink-resistant |
| **Generic food grade** | 6mm or 8mm ID | ~$8-12/3m | Check reviews for quality |

**Recommendation:** **8mm ID x 12mm OD food-grade silicone** (~$15 for 5m). Get at least 3-4 meters.

- [Quickun Tubing on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Quickun-Silicone-Tubing-Flexible-Transfer/dp/B0852HYVW4)

**Also buy:**
- **Hose clamps** (8-12mm) – ~$5 for a pack of 10
- **Teflon tape** – ~$3 – for sealing threaded connections

---

### 5. Insulated Reservoir (~$15-30)

A small cooler box holds the water and keeps it cold, reducing chiller workload.

| Option | Capacity | Price | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|-------|
| **Small camping cooler** | 5-10L | ~$15-25 | Best option |
| **Styrofoam box** | Varies | ~$5 | Works but fragile |

**Recommendation:** A **5-10L camping cooler** (~$20). Cut holes in the lid for tubes. The insulation keeps water cold longer.

**Where to buy:** Harald Nyborg, Biltema, Bauhaus, or any outdoor store.

**Pro tip:** Add a frozen gel pack to the reservoir before bed for faster initial cooling.

---

### 6. Accessories (~$30-50)

| Item | Price | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Smart plug** | ~$15-20 | Schedule cooling to start 30min before bed |
| **Thermometer** | ~$10 | Monitor water temperature |
| **Distilled water** | ~$5 | Prevents algae and mineral buildup |
| **Zip ties** | ~$5 | Cable/tube management |

Water flows: **Reservoir → Pump → Pad → Chiller → back to Reservoir**

### Step-by-Step Setup

**1. Prepare the reservoir**
- Cut two holes in the cooler lid (sized for your tubing)
- Place the pump inside the cooler
- The chiller's return line also goes into the cooler

**2. Connect the loop**
- **Pump outlet** → Tubing → **Pad inlet**
- **Pad outlet** → Tubing → **Chiller inlet**
- **Chiller outlet** → Tubing → **Back to reservoir**
- Secure all connections with hose clamps

**3. Fill and bleed**
- Fill reservoir with **distilled water** (2-3 liters typically)
- Turn on pump first (chiller OFF)
- Let water circulate to purge air bubbles
- Lift the pad higher than the pump to help air escape
- Top up water as needed

**4. Test run (daytime)**
- Turn on chiller, set to 20°C initially
- Check ALL connections for leaks
- Let it run for 30 minutes
- Feel the pad – it should be noticeably cool

**5. Install on bed**
- Place waterproof mattress protector on mattress
- Place cooling pad on top
- Put fitted sheet over everything
- Route tubes to the side/foot of bed

**6. Optimize**
- Set chiller to your preferred temp (15-18°C is common)
- Use smart plug to schedule start time
- Add frozen gel pack for extra-cold start

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Pad not getting cold | Air in system | Re-bleed the loop |
| Pad not getting cold | Pump too weak | Upgrade pump flow rate |
| Leaks at connections | Loose clamps | Tighten or add more clamps |
| Chiller running constantly | Target temp too low | Raise target 2-3°C |
| Noisy operation | Chiller vibration | Place on foam mat |
| Water cloudy/green | Algae growth | Drain, clean, refill with distilled water + drop of H2O2 |

---

## Maintenance

- **Weekly:** Check water level, top up if needed
- **Monthly:** Check connections for leaks, clean pump intake
- **Every 3-6 months:** Drain and refill with fresh distilled water
- **Yearly:** Clean chiller's air intake/filter

---

## Optional: Full Sleep Pod Enclosure

If you want to go beyond just cooling and create a full "sleep pod" with light/sound isolation, see the sections below.

### Pod Frame & Blackout Curtains

Build a canopy frame around your bed using wooden beams (38-45mm pine/spruce) and hang blackout curtains on all sides.

**Materials:**
- 4 vertical posts (~200cm tall)
- Horizontal beams for top frame
- **IKEA MAJGULL** blackout curtains (145×250cm) – 2-4 panels
- Curtain rods or Velcro for hanging
- L-brackets and wood screws

**Tips:**
- Ensure overlap where curtains meet (no light leaks)
- Leave gap at bottom for airflow
- Use Velcro strips to seal edges when closed

### Acoustic Treatment (Optional)

For noise reduction, add acoustic foam panels to the interior:
- 30×30cm pyramid foam panels
- Attach to headboard area and ceiling
- Won't block low frequencies but reduces echoes

### Ventilation

If fully enclosed, add a small USB fan (120mm PC fan) at one corner to circulate air. This prevents stuffiness without creating a draft.

### LED Lighting

Add an LED strip along the top frame for ambient lighting. Use warm/red tones at night to avoid disrupting melatonin.
